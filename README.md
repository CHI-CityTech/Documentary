# Documentary
This repository stores assets and planning for documentary development

We will be using this [Dropbox Repository](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cf3lopigg59hr6n47q8mh/ABzCfCgeAViMqP2JqGFIRxc?rlkey=r8y8f8iyzvl2xzl3c4guricpe&st=xgzwr740&dl=0) to store our materials.  

THis is the link to our Archival log with all the assets stored [BSPT Video Archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hvM8PBp4c_jUJMIUe25zSHVzNUt8lUL74MBnv_OtW8c/edit?usp=sharing)
